# Mission to Mars


Web scraping project using Python, HTML, MongoDB, Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Chrome, Bootstrap. 

## Overview of Project


In this project we are web scraping Internet sites to collect data in the form of text, images and tables. First Chrome is directed by Splinter to go to a web page we determine. With the help of BeautifulSoup and the HTML structure of the web page we determine which elements we want to scape, and we send them to MongoDB for storage. The elements collected are organized in a Flask application for visualization, with the HTML structure that we define, some styling is added using Bootstrap.
